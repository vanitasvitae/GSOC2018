# Summer of Code 2018 - OpenPGP for XMPP Instant Messaging in Smack

This is the project page for my Summer of Code project 2018.

## Code

You can find the code I'm working on in the following repositories:

* [Smack](https://github.com/igniterealtime/Smack): Progress can be found in the openpgp branch 
in my [fork](https://github.com/vanitasvitae/Smack/tree/openpgp).
* [pgpainless](https://github.com/vanitasvitae/pgpainless): In order to implement OpenPGP 
functionality for Smack, I forked the project 
[bouncy-gpg](https://github.com/neuhalje/bouncy-gpg) and made some modifications.
